However, with its ever increasing magnitude and throughput; analysing this unstructured data has become an impossibly tedious task. This has led to the rise of Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and tools as the go-to for examining and processing large amounts of natural text data.\n\nBut once we have some text mined output, what to we do then? Do these text mining techniques simply produce the insights we are trying to uncover?\n\nGrakn, addressed these questions in a simple and intuitive manner.",
